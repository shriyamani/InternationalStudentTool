**Project: Website - College Finder**
This project was created to be a tool which helps students looking to go to college internationally access all the information they would need to study
abroad in one centralized location. 

There are three components to the website- the first being a database of all the countries in the world and basic information about each one so students can familiarize themselves with the regions they are looking to attend college in. There is also a currency converter feature that allows students to convert between the currency of their home country and the currency of the country they are looking to go to college in so they can get a sense of the financial feasibility that attending university would have on one’s family or to sort the economics of their study abroad out prior. Finally, there is a college search button that allows for students to browse a variety of different of higher education universities from any country in the world as well as search up a specific university so they can access the website of that establishment and learn more about they aid in the college research process and can be a great tool for students to use when they wish to attend college abroad but don’t know where to start.

### Design Choices:
The primary design choices debated in this project were on the home page intended for user customization.  

- A Dark Mode button was added to switch the color theme of the page from light to dark in order to provide the user with the most comfortable viewing experience aesthetically. This choice was ultimately made to provide a more sophisticated user interface and cater to individual preference as much as possible.
- A Filter Region button was added to the home page that allows users to filter the search to only display countries from a specific continent- this was done to add to the complexity of the website but also make it more convenient for students set on studying in a specific region to specify their search criterion.
- Preview boxes were added for each country rather than simply having buttons listing each of the countries out so users could get a country’s basic information as soon as they access the website and to make the website more aesthetically pleasing. 
- Rather than having a conversion box that displays both the amount converted from and converted to, I had the input box be separate from the converted amount field which is enlarged at the top of the page so as to be clearer to the user and more convenient for viewing purposes. 
- When a specific university or country is typed in the search box, a preview box with the university’s region as well as a link to that university’s website is be provided in order to take the user directly to the source of their needed information.
